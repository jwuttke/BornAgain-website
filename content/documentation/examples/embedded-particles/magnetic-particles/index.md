## Magnetic particles

This example demonstrates how to include particles with non-zero magnetization. The sample consist on magnetic spherical particles embedded in the substrate of a simple 2-layer system. The beam is polarized and the analysis focuses on the spin-flip channel.

A more detailed description of this example can be found in the [Magnetic Particles Tutorial]({{% ref-tutorial "particles/magnetic-particles/index.md" %}}).
